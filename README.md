<h2 style="color:#FF1493;">🧪 QA Engineer | Automation Enthusiast | Bug Whisperer</h2>

Welcome to my corner of the internet where tests pass, bugs tremble, and quality always wins.  
I’m an experienced Manual and Automation Tester who believes that software testing isn’t just about finding bugs, it’s about building confidence in what we deliver.

## 🧰 My Testing Toolbox  

![WebdriverIO](https://img.shields.io/badge/WebdriverIO-FF69B4?style=for-the-badge&logo=webdriverio&logoColor=white)
![BrowserStack](https://img.shields.io/badge/BrowserStack-FF69B4?style=for-the-badge&logo=browserstack&logoColor=white)
![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF69B4?style=for-the-badge&logo=postman&logoColor=white)

Here’s what keeps my tests sharp and my sanity (mostly) intact:  
⚙️ **WebdriverIO** – My go-to for elegant end-to-end automation.  
🌐 **BrowserStack** – Because “it works on my machine” is *not* a valid excuse.  
🔗 **Postman** – Making sure APIs are polite, responsive, and well-behaved.  
🕵️‍♀️ **Manual Testing** – Where instincts meet precision: functional, regression, exploratory, and UAT.

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)

![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Actions-FF69B4?style=for-the-badge&logo=github-actions&logoColor=white)
![Azure DevOps](https://img.shields.io/badge/Azure%20DevOps-FF69B4?style=for-the-badge&logo=azure-devops&logoColor=white)

I’m a firm believer that testing shouldn’t stop at the local environment.  
Through **CI/CD pipelines**, I ensure that tests run automatically, reliably, and consistently — across builds, environments, and pull requests.

🧩 Integrate **automated test suites** into CI pipelines for every PR and deployment.  
🚦 Use **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions** to automate regression and E2E tests.  
🚀 Support faster, more stable releases by catching issues early and maintaining quality gates.  
🧠 Implement test result tracking and reporting to ensure visibility and accountability.  

> _“Because nothing says ‘peace of mind’ like a green check on your pipeline.”_ ✅

## 💼 QA Expertise  

My QA journey has been packed with hands-on experience across projects and teams that value quality, collaboration, and user trust.  

Here’s what I bring to the table:  

🧾 **Test Planning:** Defining scope, objectives, and risk coverage for each sprint or release.  
🧪 **Test Case Design & Execution:** Writing detailed, reusable test cases aligned with acceptance criteria.    
🧩 **Defect Tracking & Reporting:** Logging, prioritizing, and verifying bugs using tools like **Azure DevOps** and **JIRA**.  
💬 **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Partnering with developers, product owners, and UX designers to align testing with business goals.  
📈 **Test Metrics & Reporting:** Communicating execution progress, coverage, and quality indicators for data-driven insights.

## 🧠 Key Soft Skills  

🛡️ **Risk Awareness & Analytical Thinking**   
I spot potential issues before they become bugs, sometimes before the code even knows it’s buggy. Think of me as a smoke detector… for software. 🔥  

💬 **Effective Communication & Collaboration**   
I translate tech speak into plain language for product owners, developers, and stakeholders. Yes, I can explain why a “minor bug” is actually a tiny apocalypse. 😅  

🌱 **Adaptability & Continuous Learning**   
Agile environments move fast, and so do I. I can switch between automation scripts, exploratory testing, and UAT in the same day. All while keeping my sanity intact (mostly). 🤹‍♂️

## 💼 My Testing Philosophy  

> 🧠 “Testing isn’t about finding bugs — it’s about building confidence.”  

I believe in quality-driven development, meaningful collaboration, and continuous learning.  
Every test I write, execute, or automate helps create better software and happier users.

## 😄 A Little QA Humor  

> Tester: “I found a bug!”</br>
> Developer: “That’s not a bug, it’s a feature.”</br>
> Tester: “Cool. I’ll feature it in the bug report.” 🐞✨
